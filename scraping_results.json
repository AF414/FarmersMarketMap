There are a good amount of seats and the food is delicious. What a great addition to the already awesome Columbus Market! I have been going to the Market since 1983 and it was the same until they added new stores and now the food court.

Come Spend Your Sunday in The Woods! Our MissionTo support & promote an economically sustainable, localized food system & business network in Mount Laurel. It is our intention to contribute to a thriving community in which growers, producers, artisans & neighbors mutually support one another by offering a location for locally-made products to be purchased. Farmers Market FAQWhen Does the Market Start?The market begins June 1, 2025 and ends October 26, 2026. It is every Sunday from 10 AM - 2 PM with extended hours for special events. Where is the Market Located?The market is located in the Rancocas Woods Village of Shops on Creek Road in Mount Laurel, NJ. It takes place off Conestoga Lane, behind our stage and courtyard adjacent to where our hot dog stand, “The Shack”, meets Creek Road.   The Shack is a small red schoolhouse-type building on the corner of Conestoga Lane and Creek Road and is located at 120 Creek Road, Mount Laurel, NJ 08054. What Happens if it Rains?We are a rain or shine event.  It is rare that a farmers market is completely canceled. HOWEVER, in the case of severe weather we may cancel the market. It will be announced by 7AM if the market will be closed for the day.   If we ever have lightning in the middle of a market day, the market needs to close down. We may call for a rain delay or close early in this instance.  Expect to be out in the rain unless it's a thunderstorm. A tropical storm or hurricane remnants is also a case for severe weather where it may be wise to close completely for everyone's safety.   Again, we will let all vendors know by 7AM and announce this on our social media platforms if the market will be closed. Can I Bring a Pet to the Market?Yes, well-behaved animals are more than welcome to join us. You must clean up after your pet. If your animal is not well-behaved or you fail to clean up after your pet, your pet will be banned from the market. Be mindful, there will be live music! Do you Take SNAP/EBT?Yes!Is There Live Music?We do have live music at our highlight events with extended hours. We are always looking for volunteer musicians to share their talents with us during our weekly markets. Interested musicians should email rancocaswoodsfm@gmail.comWhen and Where is Yoga Located?Yoga is across the street from the vendors, on the other side of Conestoga Lane, behind the community garden. It starts at 10 AM. There is no yoga on dates with extended hours.When and Where are Workshops Located?Workshops are located in the same place yoga is. It is across the street from the vendors, on the other side of Conestoga Lane, behind the community garden. They start at 12 PM. What Amenities are Available?Amenities on and near the property include restaurants, hiking trails, outdoor seating, and restrooms. Hiking trails can be accessed off Rancocas Blvd on our side of Rancocas State Park. Who Can be a Vendor? How Do I Apply to Become a Vendor?We are open to a myriad of vendors. We try to only accept vendors within a 60 mile radius of the market. We host farmers, bakers, cooks, crafters, nonprofits, and niche agricultural vendors. We are always looking for unique, environmentally conscious vendors, so don’t hesitate to reach out to apply. Farmers Market Vendors can sign up using: www.managemymarket.comCan Nonprofit Vendors Ask for Donations?Yes, nonprofits can ask for donations with approval. Any unapproved solicitation of funds will result in removal from the market. What About Political Affiliations?No candidates or person may use the market for political gain. No political activities will be allowed at the market.

Since May 2000, the Collingswood Farmers Market has helped bring local, fresh, nutritionally dense food to our community while helping to keep farmers farming. What started as a small market with 12 farms has grown into a regular part of the Saturday mornings of the residents of Collingswood and so many surrounding townsn.Our list of farmers and vendors has grown exponentially, allowing market-goers to buy everything from produce to meat to flowers and everything in between - all while sipping a fresh, hot cup of coffee from local coffee roasters, grabbing breakfast made with fresh, local ingredients and enjoying live music from local musicians.There are few things better than knowing the people who grow the foods you're consuming. While shopping at our market, you can be confident in the fact that you're improving the quality of the foods you eat, preserving our environment and supporting your local economy. From the first Saturday in May through the Saturday before Thanksgiving, we're outside underneath the Patco High Speedline between Collings and Irvin Ave, rain or shine from 8:00am until noon. Find the big blue water towers, you'll find the market! THANKS TO OUR A-MAIZE-ING 2025 SPONSORS!
